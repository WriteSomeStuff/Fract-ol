# Fract-ol - @Codam
Mandelbrot and Julia fractals made with *MLX42* graphics library.

## How does it work?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WriteSomeStuff/Fract-ol.git
cd Fract-ol
make
./fractol mandelbrot
or
./fractol julia
```
- A window should open with the chosen set. The Julia set will open as a circle when the mouse isn't inside the window borders on starting. In the Julia set you can use your mouse position to change which Julia set is visible.

- Zoom in or out with scroll (it follows mouse position). It will take some getting used to.

- You can use arrowkeys to move around.

- You can resize the window and you can close the window with ESC.

I'll fix bugs at a later date, planning to improve this project. Other projects are keeping me busy at the moment :)
